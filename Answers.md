1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

  React is a component library that is used to create web apps. It makes us able to dynamically alter certain parts of our applications by keeping track of app variables known as state, which cause our site to update based on changes and user inputs. 

1. Describe component state.

  State is a value held in a certain component that controls various aspects of a web page and stores important application information.

1. Describe props.

  Props are key-value pairs passed down through React components as JSX properties.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

  Side effects are changes to the application interface or content that are caused by event hooks (such as state and effect). These changes frequently update page content or even the interface. You can use dependency arrays in your hooks to sync component effects with your state or property values.
